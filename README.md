Thanks for the Buff

Never let a friend go unnoticed. Whether you’re roaming the open world or deep in a high-stakes raid, Thanks for the Buff automates your appreciation for helpful strangers and keeps you informed when your teammates are pulling their weight in combat.

In the heat of battle, it’s easy to miss that clutch Power Infusion or a life-saving Lay on Hands. TFTB ensures you stay aware of the support you’re receiving while fostering a friendlier community—all without you having to lift a finger.

✨ Key Features

* Automatically reacts with a random emote (Cheer, Thank, Salute, etc.) when a stranger buffs you. Keep the good vibes flowing! (Happens when you are out of combat.)
* Tracks major combat cooldowns from your party and raid members, printing a notification in your chat (or optionally sending them a message) so you know exactly who is looking out for you.
* Fully Customizable:
  * Class-Specific Tracking: Choose exactly which spells you want to track, from Bloodlust to Misdirection.
  * Anti-Spam Protection: Built-in safety timers and cooldowns ensure you don't spam chat or emotes in busy cities.
  * Messaging Options: Choose to keep notifications private (Self-only), whisper your benefactor, or stay silent and let your emotes do the talking.
  * The "Thank You" Button: Automatically creates a custom macro named "- Thank". Target a player and hit the button to instantly send a personalized whisper and a random emote—perfect for thanking healers, mages for water, or warlocks for portals.

🛠️ Configuration

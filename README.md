# Thanks for the Buff! (TFTB)

A simple add-on that automatically expresses happiness with an emote whenever you receive a new buff.

Build in, optional `/thankyou` slash-command to send a thank you message to the targeted player. Set this up as a macro for when people give you water, or a portal. (=

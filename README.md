# Thanks for the Buff! (TFTB)

A simple add-on that automatically expresses happiness with an emote whenever you receive a new buff.

* Will only work when you are not in combat.
* Will only work when you receive buffs from people outside of your party / raid group.

游꾸 There is also a built-in `/thankyou` slash command to send a thank-you message to the targeted player. You can set this up as a macro for when someone tosses you a heal, gives you some water or a portal, or whatever.
